<h1> 김치전 Kimchi jeon (kimchi pancakes)</h1>
<div class="ingredients"> ingredients:
½ pound napa cabbage kimchi, chopped into small pieces,
plus 2 tablespoons of the brine
3 scallions, chopped
½ teaspoon sugar
½ cup all-purpose flour
½ cup water
4 tablespoons vegetable oil</div>


<div class="instructions">Instructions:<p></p> 
<p></p> 
1.	Thinly slice the kimchi, about 1/2-inch thick. Cut the scallions into about 2-inch pieces. If the white part is thick, cut in half lengthwise. Thinly slice the onion.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
2.	In a large bowl, combine the flour (or pancake mix) with the kimchi juice, the optional gochujang/gochugaru and egg, and water, a little bit at a time. If you use gochujang start with dissolving the gochujang with water, and mix everything together. Do not over mix. <p></p> 
<p></p> 
3.	Add a little more water if the batter is too thick. The batter should flow easily from a spoon.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
4.	Stir in the kimchi, spring onions, onion and the optional protein of your choice if you want to add meat.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
5.	Heat one tablespoon of oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Ladle the mixture into the pan, and spread it evenly into a thin round shape. Cook until the edges turn light golden brown, about 3 minutes. Turn it over, and add more oil to the sides of the pan. Gently swirl the pan to distribute the oil under the pancakes. Press the pancake down with a spatula. Cook until the other side is nicely browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
6.	Repeat the process until there is no remaining batter. Serve hot with a dipping sauce, if you want to be fancy.<p></p>
